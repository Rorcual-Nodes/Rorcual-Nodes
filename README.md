Rorcual Nodes is a project developed by 2 crypto enthusiasts that got hooked by Team Kujira's project. Our goal is to become one of the main Kujira L1 validators by providing quality to the chain infrastructure and adding value to the community.

Our nodes are based in physical servers located in Spain, near to the Mediterranean Sea where rorcual whales live. By delegating to Rorcual, you are contributing to the decentralization and security of the Kujira network.

Itâ€™s our focus create a platform where all delegators are treated as investors in a company. Every  governance decision should be meditated and explained to the community so everyone can understand the evolution of Kujira Blockchain.

Rorcual nodes are secured by high end encryption provided by hardware security  modules that prevent the leakage of private keys. Validators are operated by a highly reduced and trusted team.
